This project aims to collect the various data related to _**Indian Premier League**_ regardless of any particular season. Our basic focus is to bring **unseen facts** through visualizing the various data figures, so that we can avail a range of good ideas & scopes about the possible data science work.

## Getting Started

 Just going through a certain steps, you can easily begin with your work!  
 Have a glimpse below:  

 1. **Grab the Data:**  
 Explore the various datasets available in the [```Datasets```](https://github.com/Team-thedatatribune/IPL-Analysis/tree/dataset-defination) directory.  
 You can contribute by adding your own dataset to this branch, as well!!  

 2. **Code Parallelly**
 Find the dataset that interests you and begin with the codes to analyse the data.  
 You can share your code regardless of the language you use to code.  

 3. **Add Visualizations**  
 You can do exploratory data analysis on the datasets and create nice graphs or other visualizations too that can bring good insights.  
 Visualization would make it more easy to understand the datasets.  

 4. **Work Independently**  
 If you are confident enough in some other field say documentation/content-presentation or enhencement, you are most welcome.  
 You can also contribute with any other work, apart from those which are mentioned above. Just, make sure they are relavent to this project.
